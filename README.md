# OpenWrt Reticulum Feed 📡

This repository contains OpenWrt packages related to the [Reticulum](https://reticulum.network/) ecosystem. The feed currently provides packages for the [Reticulum Network Stack](https://github.com/markqvist/Reticulum), an open-source cryptography-based networking stack designed for reliable communication over high-latency, low-bandwidth networks.

## Current Status ⚠️

This feed is under active development and not yet ready for general use.

We are working on stabilizing the packages and resolving various implementation challenges, particularly around Python module integration in OpenWrt's constrained environment.

## Available Packages 📦

This feed provides the following packages:

### rnspure 🌐
Pure Python variant of the Reticulum Network Stack with no external dependencies required for installation.

### rns 🌐
The core Reticulum Network Stack implementation with Python dependencies.

### lxmf 💬
Lightweight Extensible Message Format implementation for messaging over Reticulum.

### nomadnet🕸️
Terminal-based resilient mesh communications platform built on LXMF and Reticulum.

### python3-urwid 🖥️
Console user interface library required by nomadnet.

Note: The `-src` packages are optional and provide the Python source code, while the standard packages contain only bytecode and metadata as is typical for OpenWrt packages. Most users will only need the standard packages.

## Prerequisites 📋

To use this feed, you need:

- A computer running some Debian
- OpenWrt buildroot environment
- This feed

## Development Setup 🛠️

### System Requirements (Debian/Ubuntu)

Install required system packages:
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -qy \
    build-essential \
    ccache \
    file \
    flex \
    bison \
    g++ \
    gawk \
    gettext \
    git \
    libncurses5-dev \
    libssl-dev \
    python3-setuptools \
    rsync \
    unzip \
    wget \
    zlib1g-dev
```

### OpenWrt Setup

1. Clone OpenWrt repository:
```bash
git clone --depth 5 https://git.openwrt.org/openwrt/openwrt.git
cd openwrt
```

2. Configure feeds:
```bash
# Create feeds configuration if it doesn't exist
[ ! -f feeds.conf ] && cp feeds.conf.default feeds.conf

# Ensure reticulum feed is properly configured
if ! grep -q '^src-git reticulum' feeds.conf; then
    # Comment out any existing reticulum entries
    sed -i '/src-git reticulum/s/^/#/' feeds.conf
    # Add our feed
    echo "src-git reticulum https://github.com/gretel/feed-reticulum.git" >> feeds.conf
fi
```

Your `feeds.conf` should look similar to this:
```
src-git packages https://git.openwrt.org/feed/packages.git
src-git luci https://git.openwrt.org/project/luci.git
src-git reticulum https://github.com/gretel/feed-reticulum.git
```

3. List using the `feeds` utility to confirm:

```bash
./scripts/feeds list -s
packages   src-git  2b999558db0711124f7b5cf4afa201557352f694 https://git.openwrt.org/feed/packages.git
luci       src-git  e76155d09484602e2b02e84bb8ffafa4848798f0 https://git.openwrt.org/project/luci.git
reticulum  src-git  3d196e9b824158b9a428892c426e8365dc02c373 https://github.com/gretel/feed-reticulum.git
```

4. Update and install from all feeds:
```bash
./scripts/feeds update -a
./scripts/feeds install -a
```

### Building Packages

For a default configuration:
```bash
make defconfig
```

To build specific packages:
```bash
# Clean and rebuild RNS package
make package/feeds/reticulum/rns/clean
make package/feeds/reticulum/rns/compile V=s
make package/index
```

> `NO_DEPS=1` will skip building dependencies. Building of the `rns` package will fail if the required dependencies have not been built before. It's meant to speed up development iterations.

> `V=s` adds very verbose output logging. Remove for proven builds.

```bash
make package/feeds/reticulum/rns/compile V=s NO_DEPS=1
```

### Building All

For a full system build (optional):
```bash
make -j$(nproc) world
```

> This could result in a bootable distribution. No testing has been done yet!

## Known Issues ⚡

- [~~Python module import issues related to OpenWrt's bytecode-only packaging~~](https://github.com/markqvist/Reticulum/issues/623)
- ~~Service initialization requires further testing~~
- Documentation needs expansion
- Implementation of systemd and procd service files needs testing
